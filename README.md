# gene-expression-prediction-project
This project was part of a hackathon to apply machine learning skills on real-world biological dataset by developing a machine learning model to predict gene expression levels across various cell types using DNA sequence information. Each input represented a DNA sequence centered on a gene’s transcription start site (TSS) extracted from the reference human genome (GRCh38). Each sequence had 49,152 nucleotides containing regulatory information that could determine the gene’s expression values in various cell types. Gene expression values across various cell types and sequencing methods were gathered from the ENCODE website. For the solution, using kipoiseq, torch, Adam optimizer, StepLR scheduler, and early stopping function we developed a CNN-based model ensemble. The model consisted of three branches, each with a different configuration of convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
